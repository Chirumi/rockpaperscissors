Problems encountered: Empty .winner div box persists when clicking replay button which messes up the spacing of other divs: made a permanent text to the div so that spacing is uniform before and after replay button 
How to make game stops when either side reaches 5 scores: made get winner function to state the conditions (=== 5) and nest it within the round result function so that for every round, condition (=== 5) is checked and if true, stops the game by removing event listener
